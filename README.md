# Survey form with React

This is a space survey form made with react. The user can select options and add information in text fields. All answers are visible in the review.
## The problem

I've had some issues with getting the user input from the radio buttons. I solved it by creating a global function for each value. If i had more time i would focus on styling of the drop down and doing a proper success page.
